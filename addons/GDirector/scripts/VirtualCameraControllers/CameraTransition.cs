// TODO Create a GroupTransitionController class that works just like this one, but that can handle transitions from
// any camera in a node group instead of a single specific group. We could go even further and also create a
// GlobalGroupTransitionController that should be attached to the GDirectorServer directly instead of to a specific
// camera, and provides a default transition for any camera in a node group that is not handled by a specific transition
// controller.
// TODO Some times, a camera transition might be triggered while another transition is already happening.
// When this happens, the camera is cut from it's position directly to the position of the virtual camera that is both
// the end of the previous transition and the start of the new transition, and then the new transition starts.
// To avoid this cut, instead of this behavior,
// the new transition should be anchored at it's start not to that virtual camera,
// but to the target positoin of the previous transition.
// (i.e. the position the camera should be positioned if that transition had not be canceled)
// This way the camera will smoothly blend from one transition to the next without an abrupt cut.
