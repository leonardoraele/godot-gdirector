# Introduction

GDirector is an addon for Godot that provides a complete solution for operating 3D cameras with dynamic behavior,
for both cutscenes and gameplay.
Inspired by Unity's Cinemachine package.

<!--
GDirector adds highly configurable pre-implemented camera behavior nodes that control the camera's position and rotation
individually, allowing you to compose procedural camera shots that are updated every frame at runtime. Because the
camera shots are procedually calculated at runtime, they remain updated even if different elements of the scene changes,
either as a result of player input or when elements are changed by you.

GDirector also has the ability interpolate between pre-configured virtual cameras, allowing you to create very
complex camera shots.

You can also configure various conditions that the virtual cameras can check to calculate their priority and let
GDirector automatically select the best camera shot at runtime, creating camera behavior that reacts to the player
automatically based on the parameters configured by you.

GDirector is designed to be expandable, so that you can create custom behaviors for your virtual cameras that are not
pre-implemented by the many GDirector pre-implemented camera behavior nodes.
