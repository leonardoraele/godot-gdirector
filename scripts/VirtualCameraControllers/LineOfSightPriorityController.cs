/// <summary>
/// This controller adds priority to the virtual camera when the target is in the line of sight of the camera.
///
/// If the target is not in the line of sight, the priority will fall off over time until it reaches zero. You can
/// configure how quickly the priority falls off  with the <see cref="FallOffDurationSec"/> and
/// <see cref="PriorityFallOff"/> properties. This is useful to prevent a camera cut when a target just breafly passes
/// behind an obstacle that breaks line of sight.
///
/// Note: This controller determines line of sight by casting a ray from the camera to the target's origin position (and
/// an optional offset). If the target has a mesh (e.g. a character) this controller might determine the target is out
/// of sight even though parts of it's body other than it's origin position might still be visible.
